Dice Game is a game with 2 players. The first player to click the "Roll dice" button will have his value displayed in the current score. The second player will make the same thing. The first value will be compared to the second value and the higher value will be displayed in the corresponding player's score. When one of the players reaches the score of 20, that is the winner!
